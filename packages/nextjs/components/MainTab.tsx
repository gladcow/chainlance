          Chainlance is a decentralized freelance marketplace. Chainlance sets itself apart from other freelance
          marketplaces by prioritizing collaboration among freelancers rather than fostering competition.

          At the core of Chainlance&apos;s strategy to foster unity among freelancers is the encouragement of project
          division and the sharing of subprojects with other freelancers.
